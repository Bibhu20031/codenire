# –°odenire Playground

Open-source online code execution system featuring
a playground and sandbox.
Built on Docker images with robust isolation provided by [Google gVisor](https://github.com/google/gvisor).

The system is easily extensible with additional technologies and languages.

Inspired by:
- Judje0 Playground: https://github.com/judge0/judge0
- Google Playground: https://github.com/golang/playground

# üåüFeatures

- Multi-Language Support: Run Python, Go, PHP and Node.js or your built code with others configurations and versions what you can think, in isolated Docker containers.
- Multi-Files Support: Run code that consists of multiple files
- Easy extensible: You can create your own build to run code via API or by loading a folder with configurations at startup.
- (in working) Dependency Management: Automatic handling of project dependencies (pip, go mod, npm)
- Flexible Execution: Custom entrypoints for both single-file code and full projects
- Scalable System: Expandable via a load balancer between a playground and a sandbox.


# üêôInfrastructure Schema

   <details><summary>Why need isolation</summary>
    <p>
    It might be convenient to keep your Firecracker-related GCP resources in
    a separate project, so that you can keep track of resources more easily
    and remove everything easily once your are done.

For convenience, give the project a unique name (e.g.,
your_name-firecracker), so that GCP does not need to create a project id
different than project name (by appending randomized numbers to the name you
provide).

   ```console
   $ gcloud projects create ${FC_PROJECT} --enable-cloud-apis --set-as-default
   ```

   </p>

**[!] The ability to register Docker images via API is not yet implemented and will be available in the near future!**

Out of the box (in development),
Dockerfiles and configurations for various languages can be found in /sandbox/dockerfiles

# Run/Set Up
You can Run Playground local (or on MacOS/Ubuntu) via Docker Compose.

**[!] If you start on MacOS you can't start with gVisor Environment**

# Deploy

- Docker compose (see [/docs/docker-compose](https://github.com/codiewio/codenire/tree/main/docs/docker-compose) dir ‚Äî without external gVisor Runtime)
- [Digital Ocean Terraform](infra/digitalocean/README.md) with load balancing and multi-sandbox cluster


# Lifecycle Request Hooks

- [ ] Add WebUI Head with Monaco
- [ ] Add Metrics
- [ ] Add Tests
- Add GoLinter
  - [x] Playground
  - [x] Sandbox
